# Car Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project uses machine learning to predict the **resale price of a used car** based on various features such as mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates the selling price of a car using historical data. It includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation (R², MAE)
- An optional web interface using Streamlit

> This project is for educational purposes and uses a small, publicly available dataset from Kaggle.

## 📊 Dataset

- Contains information such as:
  - Present price
  - Mileage
  - Car age
  - Fuel type
  - Seller type
  - Transmission
  - Number of previous owners

## 🧠 ML Model

- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Evaluation metrics:** R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler
